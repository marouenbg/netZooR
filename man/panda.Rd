\usage{
panda(motif, expr = NULL, ppi = NULL, alpha = 0.1, hamming = 0.001,
  iter = NA, output = c("regulatory", "coexpression", "cooperative"),
  zScale = TRUE, progress = FALSE, randomize = c("None", "within.gene",
  "by.gene"), cor.method = "pearson", scale.by.present = FALSE,
  edgelist = FALSE, remove.missing.ppi = FALSE,
  remove.missing.motif = FALSE, remove.missing.genes = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{Character string indicatining the file path of expression values file, with each gene (in row) by samples (in columns)}

\item{m}{An optional character string indicatining the file path of pair file of a prior transcription factor binding motifs dataset.
When this argument is not provided, analysis will continue with Pearson correlation matrix.}

\item{ppi}{An optional character string indicatining the file path of protein-protein interaction edge dataset.
Also this can be generated given a list of proteins of interest by \code{\link{source.PPI}}.}

\item{rm_missing}{an optional boolean indicatining whether to remove genes and tfs not present in all input files. If TRUE, remove all unmatched tf and genes.
if FALSE, keep all tf and genes. The default value is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list of three itemsï¼š
         Use \code{$panda} to access the standard output of PANDA network in data.frame, which consists of four columns: 
         "tf", "gene", "motif" 0 or 1 to indicate if this edge belongs to prior motif dataset, and "force".

         Use \code{$indegree} to access the indegree of PANDA network in data.frame, consisting of two columns: "gene", "force".

         Use \code{$outdegree} to access the outdegree of PANDA network in data.fra,e, consisting of two columns: "tf", "force".
}
\description{
\strong{PANDA}(Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation) is a message-passing model 
to reconstruct gene regulatory network. It integrates multiple sources of biological data-including protein-protein interaction,
gene expression data, and transccription factor binding motifs data-to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks.
\href{http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064832}{[(Glass et al. 2013)])}
This function is designed to run the a derived PANDA algorithm in Python from \href{https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy}{netZooPy},
 which is also a Python library of netZooR.

\examples{
# take the treated TB dataset as example here.
# refer to the datasets files path in inst/extdat

treated_expression_file_path <- system.file("extdata", "expr4_matched.txt", package = "netZooR", mustWork = TRUE)
motif_file_path <- system.file("extdata", "chip_matched.txt", package = "netZooR", mustWork = TRUE)
ppi_file_path <- system.file("extdata", "ppi_matched.txt", package = "netZooR", mustWork = TRUE)

\item{cor.method}{Correlation method, default is "pearson".}

# Run PANDA for treated and control network
treated_all_panda_result <- panda(e = treated_expression_file_path, m = motif_file_path, ppi = ppi_file_path, rm_missing = TRUE )

# access PANDA regulatory network
treated_net <- treated_all_panda_result$panda

# access PANDA regulatory indegree network.
indegree_net <- treated_all_panda_result$indegree

# access PANDA regulatory outdegree networks
outdegree_net <- treated_all_panda_result$outdegree

\item{remove.missing.genes}{Boolean to indicate whether genes in the expression data but lacking
information from the motif prior should be removed.}
}
