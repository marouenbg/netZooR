\usage{
runPanda(e = expression, m = motif, ppi = ppi, rm_missing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{Character String indicatining the file path of expression values file, as each gene (row) by samples (columns) \emph{required}}

\item{m}{Character String indicatining the file path of pair file of motif edges,
when not provided, analysis continues with Pearson correlation matrix. \emph{optional}}

\item{ppi}{Character String indicatining the pair file path of Protein-Protein interaction dataset. \emph{optional}}

\item{rm_missing}{Boolean indicatining whether to remove missing values. If TRUE, removes missing values.
if FALSE, keep missing values. THe default value is FALSE. \emph{optional}}

List of three itemsï¼š
 Use \code{$panda} to access the entire data frame of PANDA output network consisting of four columns: 
"tf", "gene", "motif", and "force".

Use \code{$indegree} to access the data frame of indegree of PANDA network, consisting of two columns: "gene", "force".

Use \code{$outdegree} to access the data frame of outdegree of PANDA network, consisting of two columns: "tf", "force".

\strong{Note}: If there is any duplicate name of nodes in first two columns,
prefix the content in regulator column with "reg_" and content in target column with"tar_"

Please re-name the colnames if needed.

\description{
\strong{PANDA}(Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation) is a message-passing model 
to gene regulatory network reconstruction. It integrates multiple sources of biological data, 
including protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif information,
in order to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks.
